      <p>
        We're Alec and Emmanuel, two engineers with over a decade's experience building full-stack web applications that don&apos;t fall apart the second you push them live.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, we use that experience to help small businesses and individuals cut through the noise and get their paws on tech that actually works. No jargon, no bloated nonsense. Just clean solutions that solve real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take accessibility seriously. Not as a buzzword, but as a core part of building a web that works for everyone. If your site scares customers away or just gives them a headache, we&apos;ll fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Senior-level skills. Straightforward solutions.
