      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility shouldn&apos;t be complicated &mdash; or boring. Here&apos;s how we do it at Monkeypatch:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Step 1. Free Consultation</span>
          <span>
            In-person or in-pixel, we&apos;ll walk through your site and goals. No cost, no pressure, just a straightforward chat about where things stand and where to go.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Step 2. Accessibility Audit</span>
          <span>
            We check your site against WCAG standards, highlight problem areas, and give you a clear report (written for humans, not robots).
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Step 3. Heavy Lifting</span>
          <span>
            We fix what needs fixing to bring your site into compliance. The audit cost gets subtracted from the work, because paying twice for the same thing is just silly.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Step 4: Protection continues!</span>
          <span>
            We will defend our work and continue to work with you to make sure that your site stays compliant.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Alec and Emmanuel, two engineers who&apos;ve spent over a decade between them building full-stack applications that don&apos;t fall apart the second you push them live.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, we use that experience to help small businesses and individuals cut through the noise and get their paws on tech that actually works. No jargon, no bloated nonsense. Just clean solutions that solve real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take accessibility seriously. Not as a buzzword, but as a core part of building a web that works for everyone. If your site scares customers away or just gives them a headache, we&apos;ll fix it.
      </p>
